# Image Gallery

This project is a simple image gallery that displays images in a responsive grid layout. It uses HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and interactive gallery where images zoom in on hover.

## Features

- Responsive design: The gallery adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Hover effect: Images zoom in smoothly when hovered over, adding a dynamic feel to the gallery.
- Grid layout: The gallery items are arranged in a grid using CSS Grid, making it easy to add, remove, or rearrange images.

## Usage
